I am looking to do a project on event retrieval - I am just starting the project and I want to do a single moment retrieval for now to first build up the system. What is the best dataset for single example retrieval. Where essentially we will have a video clip and we need to find the best match for a video clip in a longer video clip if that makes sense - is there an existing dataset for this that is commonly used? This is essentially video/clip retrieval - please find this
